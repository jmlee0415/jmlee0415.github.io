### Regional Sales Comparison

Testdome 무료 문제 중 가장 고민을 많이 했던 SQL 문제이다! </br>
(링크 : https://www.testdome.com/questions/sql/regional-sales-comparison/69920?visibility=1&skillId=1483) </br>
</br>

```
An insurance company maintains records of sales made by its employees. Each employee is assigned to a state. States are grouped under regions. The following tables contain the data:

TABLE regions
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL

TABLE states
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  regionId INTEGER NOT NULL
  FOREIGN KEY (regionId) REFERENCES regions(id)

TABLE employees
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
  stateId INTEGER NOT NULL
  FOREIGN KEY (stateId) REFERENCES states(id)

TABLE sales
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL
  employeeId INTEGER NOT NULL
  FOREIGN KEY (employeeId) REFERENCES employees(id)  
Management requires a comparative region sales analysis report.

Write a query that returns:

The region name.
Average sales per employee for the region (Average sales = Total sales made for the region / Number of employees in the region).
The difference between the average sales of the region with the highest average sales, and the average sales per employee for the region (average sales to be calculated as explained above).
Employees can have multiple sales. A region with no sales should be also returned. Use 0 for average sales per employee for such a region when calculating the 2nd and the 3rd column.
```

아래는 테스트 케이스를 모두 통과한 답안이다. (MySQL 언어 사용)
sale 테이블에 없는 직원을 간과하여 한참을 고민했었다..ㅜ


```sql

with tmp as 
(select a.id as'Id', a.name as 'aname', 
ifnull(sum(amount)/count(distinct c.id),0) as 'avg_sale' 
from regions as a 
left join states as b on a.id = b.regionId 
left join employees as c on b.id = c.stateId
left join sales as d on c.id = d.employeeId 
group by a.id)

select aname, avg_sale, max(avg_sale)over()-avg_sale from tmp 

```
